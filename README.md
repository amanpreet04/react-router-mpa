# React Router: Basic Concepts

This project delves into the basics of using React Router. I discovered the best practices of linking pages using `Link` and `NavLink` and there use cases. Additionally, I understood how differently relative and absolute paths work, and how to save ourselves from common pitfalls. I also built and used dynamic routes. These dynamic paths were then linked to the underlying HTML elements using Links/NavLinks.
